# Artificial_Intelligence UNIMORE 2024/2025 course
This repository contains the material for the course of Artificial Intelligence at UNIMORE for the academic year 2024/2025.   
Professor: [Simone Calderara](https://personale.unimore.it/rubrica/dettaglio/calderara)

## Mchine Learning and Deep Learning

### Course Goals
The aim of this course is to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively apply
existing machine learning models and algorithms to solve real-world problems. 

The course will cover:
- Classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction and Ensemble Methods
- Model selection, regularization, design of experiments, model evaluation

This course will not teach you how to design new machine learning algorithms but instead
understand and select the most appropriate for your problem/data

## Laboartory
To use or test the algorithms and models in this repository follow this steps:
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone
```
2. Go to the `LAB` directory
```bash
cd LAB
```
### Linux - MacOS
3. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
4. Activate the virtual environment
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
### Windows
3. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
4. Activate the virtual environment
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
5. Install the requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Now you can run the scripts in the `LAB` directory
```bash
python script.py
```
